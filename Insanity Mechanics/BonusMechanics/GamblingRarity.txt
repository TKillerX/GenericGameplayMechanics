Effects
Gamble Skills are all unique with very specific effects. 

The dice rolled for a gamble skill is predetermined, a D6 can have a skill that does a D20 while still using dexterity.

The status effects are predetermined, this allows classes to obtain debuffs normally not allowed for them.

The skills may have bonuses that cannot be obtained otherwise.

Random Effect 1
Dice ~> They are always equal to or higher than the current class
D4/D6/D8/D10/D12/D20

Random Effect 2
Status ~> Applies 3 Randomly Chosen status effects
They are All positive or All negative

Random Effect 3
Power Multiplier ~> Multiply power of the skill based on the odds of the skill activating.
1/2 -> 2x Power.
1/4 -> 4x Power.
etc.
