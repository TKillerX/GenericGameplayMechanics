Skills with a requirement that must be met to activate, but in turn, give crazy effects.
Requirement 1: Must be after 2 rare skills.
Requirement 2: Must be used in a specific spot in the chain.
Requirement 3: Unique to the skill.

Effects
Gamble Skills are all unique with very specific effects. 
The dice rolled for a gamble skill is predetermined, a D6 can have a skill that does a D20 while still using dexterity.
The status effects are predetermined, this allows classes to obtain debuffs normally not allowed for them.
The skills may have bonuses that cannot be obtained otherwise.
