Finishing a hit while the target has a specific status effect can allow a chain. Chained skills add bonus damage while also applying its effect at a decreased effectiveness. Skills can only be chained once. Chained Skills lose 10% of their dice per chain.

Chain Finisher
Chain Finisher: A Drainless Basic Attack with added power based on the power of the chain. Each chain has a power boost depending on the rarity of the skill, stronger chains produce stronger power boosts. All of the chain power is added at the end to boost this attackâ€™s power. A Chain Finisher uses up all the status effects applied by the chain to apply special effects unique to the class.

A skill needs a minimum of 100 Power to continue a chain.

Chain Breaker
After the 3rd chained skill, roll to break out of the chain replacing the 10 in normal AC calculations with a D20. To break the chain, the AC must exceed the original hit chance.

Chain Maintainer
Rolling above these values for the dice increases hit by 1. Crits count as a 20 base hit.
