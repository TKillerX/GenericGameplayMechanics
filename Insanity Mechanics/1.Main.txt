An combat oriented system using a variety of dice to determine effectiveness. This system focuses on a variety of bufs and debuffs that inturn boost damage. This system is very determined on risk and reward and outsmarting the debuffs.


Note: 
	Should probably get reworked to reduce randomness. There's so much going on it is so hard to keep track of.

	Should probably get reworked to reduce buffs and debuff effectiveness. Possibly only have one buff and one debuff active at a time. This would stop long fights turning into walking with 100 buffs and 100 debuffs.

	Redo Proficiencies to take into account only 1 status active at a time
