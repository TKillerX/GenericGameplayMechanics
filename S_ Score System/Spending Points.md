Points can be spent on temporary or permanent bonuses. This can be anything, but there is one important rule:

> DO NOT SCALE ANYTHING ON POINT TOTAL

Do not have abilities get stronger the more saved total.
Do not have stats that are directly influenced by it.
Do not have passives that check the number.

It can be used as a power level where a higher score means more power, but it should never be used as such.

Points not supposed to scale due to how abundant it is. Don't even try.

## The score is not a shop
Points can be spent but not like how a shop has things for sale. Shops get restocked and put the same things out for similar prices. That won't work with points since the expensive thing now can be very cheap later. 

Permanent Boosts can only be bought once.
Temporary Boosts is dependent of how much the player is willing to spend. Don't give temporary bonuses to anything that gives points. It may offset the cost.

Example
Permanent Boosts (Once)
100 Points - 1 Skill point
1000 Points - 1 Skill point
10 000 Points - 1 Skill point
100 000 Points - 1 Skill point

Temporary Boosts
20% Score - 2x Defense
40% Score - A Hint
60% Score - Temporary Custom Skill

When making permanent boosts up on the fly, make it higher than what they currently have. Give them a goal.
