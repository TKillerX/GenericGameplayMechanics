## Point Ranges
### 10 - Okay

Okay points are pity points. It is points for when something will eventually work but almost anything else will be better. They are to guide to player away from their task and to do something else. Okay points can be handed to stop repetitive tasks and grinding.

### 100 - Good
> "You are doing exactly as I expected. Good for you"

Good points are the standard. They are when the player does something and it works. To stop repetition, repeated tasks should become Okay.

### 1000 - Great
> "You are going above and beyond. Good work."

Great points are for when the player uses more than brute force to accomplish a goal. It is for thinking ahead and understanding risks.

### 10000 - Amazing
> "I didn't even think that was possible. How did you-?"

Amazing points are for situations when the player exceeds expectation and does more than you thought was possible. If you find yourself handing out these points often, think things through more.
