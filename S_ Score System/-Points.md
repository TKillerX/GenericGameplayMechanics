-Points are punishments. They say "Stop" or "Hurry" or "Failed". -Points are rare and in general the GM should be leading with +points instead of pushing with -points.

### STOP
> "Don't do that . . . yet."

Stop points are to attempt to stop the player from doing something they are not ready for. Stop points could be a sort of cost to progress, a blockade that can be worked around, or both. 

Example:
Flaming Wall: -10,000 Points to Cross. Completing "Volcano" Quest disables the flames.

### Hurry
> "You don't have time to waste"

Hurry points are to get the player to finish something as quickly as possible. A timer. Hurry points are typically relatively small but would obviously add up over time.

Example:
Poison Gas: -1,000 every turn until the player leaves

### Failed
> "I don't know how you managed."

Failed points tell the player that they messed up. They happen when the player fails to avoid something very avoidable. They messed up big time and these points reflect it.

Example:
Time Bomb: Reach the bomb in 5 turns, else it explodes for -10,000 Points.
