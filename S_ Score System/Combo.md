## Combo
Combos should gain multipliers based on the length of the combo. To avoid an infinite combo, they must have one of these 2 things.
- A limit
- Chance to fail
It is fine for parts of a combo to be guaranteed, but it should eventually become riskier and riskier to continue. 

When a combo **breaks** and fails, the multiplier can no longer be used and all points are lost.

### Negative Combo
Some tasks are too easy to have a combo for. The same way points can be decreased for lack of variety, so can combos. Negative combos don't give negative points, but instead divide based on the severity.
