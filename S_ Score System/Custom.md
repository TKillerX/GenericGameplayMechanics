## Custom Points
Custom Points should scale to be around Good.
- Example: In a system where HP is about 10 - 100 and it is expected for combat to take about 3 turns, Damage x 10 for points work.

In a system where HP is about 10 - 1bil, things get more difficult. (Advice, avoid that) But, there are still options to take very high scaling.

**Relative Scaling**
Scale the points with a logarithm, or more simply, multiply by number of zeros.
1 million (1 000 000) has 6 Zeros. Multiply a Good by 6 for 600 points.

Pros: Simple on the GM side, Scores stay readable
Cons: Conversions have an extra step of counting zeros. 

**Prestige Scaling**
Scale everything else up and prestige the points. Once a threshold is reached such as custom point total exceeding 1000, increase all point values by 10x.

100 Damage would be 1 000 points, a Great.
After all point values are raised by 10x.
Okay - 100
Good - 1 000
Great - 10 000
Amazing - 100 000
100 Damage will still be 1000 points, but it will instead be a Good.

Pros: Keeps numbers increasing to feel more powerful
Cons: Can get so big that it is hard to know what is happening anymore

## Negative Points
For most custom points there should be negative antagonizing points. These aren't meant to directly cancel points gained, they are meant to continue to push the player to get better.

Example : Damage
Player Damage and Enemy Damage
The higher the Enemy Damage, the higher the player damage must be to be Net 0.

Example : Farming
Good Crops and Bad Crops
The more points it takes to pull a crop, the higher the player's skill must be to be Net 0.
