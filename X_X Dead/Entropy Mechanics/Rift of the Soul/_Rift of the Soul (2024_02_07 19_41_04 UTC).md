Introduction: You are part of a crew leading a spaceship. Your destination is a planet that your navigator says has a unique energy signature and she would like to check out. Your crew consists of:

Captain:
>>Once a session, refill someone's stamina
Artificial Intelligence: Magneta
>>Calculate Senarios (Plot)
Navigator: Cyan
>>Three times a session, find something
Engineer:
>>Three times a session, build something to solve an immediate problem
Chemist:
>>Three times a session, instantly nullify a status effect
Chef: 
>>Three times a session, reduce revenge by 1
Janitor: Gold
>>Abnormally Strong

While landing the ship, a rift in space opens up and surrounds the ship. Every crew member gets an alien attached to them with no signs of being able to get it off. The navigator says the energy signature may have enough power to seperate the aliens, dubbed The Rift, from the crew else the aliens would attempt to take over the minds of their host like a parasite.

You crashland in a valley, in a small body of water surrounded by steep mountains. This planet seems to have lots of geological activity which means the longer you stay, the more damage that can be caused to the ship, especially when between two mountains. The fauna of this planet is hostile and will attack if they find you.

While on the planet there's two energy sources.

One somewhere underground.
One at the top of a mountain

Your artificial intelligence is capable of tracking it, but it is currently stuck into your ship. It says if you bring back a living animal it may be able to hook itself into the brain of it and lead the group. This should be your first goal.
