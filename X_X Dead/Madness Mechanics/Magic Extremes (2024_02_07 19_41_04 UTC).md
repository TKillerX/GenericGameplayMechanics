##### #Order - #Architect
Appears in low entropy

“Architects. They keep the universe from being bored. Stay away from them, they will be more than happy to use you as pieces for their next creation. You’ll know when an architect is near, their buildings don’t have to follow the rules that you know.”

##### #Entropy - #Elementals
Appears in both high entropy or low entropy.

“Elementals. They keep things moving, they make things exciting. They exist in pairs, one sends energy to the other who lays dormant. When one activates, they cause what you would call a natural disaster.” 

##### #Contain - #Wisps
Appears in low energy or high energy.

“Wisps. They are containers for energy. They appear by absorbing the energy from intense systems and reappear in places of low energy. This energy can be absorbed by anything.”

##### #Release - #Destroyer
Appears in high energy

“Destroyers. They make sure nothing stays the same for too long. They destroy everything they touch on contact. Do not confuse them with an organic being, they are the embodiment of destruction.”


##### Extremes
1000+ Used Energy is High Energy.
1000+ Pounds of Potential Energy is High Entropy.
A completely empty field has low Entropy.

Effects are a # of D6 with a maximum total being the maximum energy it has.
