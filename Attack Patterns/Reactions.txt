Reactions
Attacks generally have two correct reactions


Avoid + Dodge > Quick
Cannot Stun Quick Attacks, there's not enough time.

Dodge + Stun  > Range
Cannot Avoid Range Attacks, they'll always reach you.

Stun + Avoid  > Heavy
Cannot Dodge Heavy Attacks, they have control over the attack.


Avoid (Run Away)
These attacks have a limited range. Running out of the range avoids the attack.
Used for: Short Ranged Attacks
Speed: Last
Reaction Requirement: No Attack**
**Being already out of range allows a ranged attack. 

Dodge (Side Step)
These attacks are typically fast and simple. 
Used for: Fast Attacks
Speed: First
Reaction Requirement : None

Stun (Attack)
Attacks that can be broken by getting hit. These attacks have some start up time.
Used for: Heavy Attacks
Speed: Average
Reaction Requirement : Fast Attack


Special Attack
Attacks with only one correct reaction
1. An enemy prepared for 1 complete turn
2. A boss's special ability
3. 2+ enemies attack together


Never EVER make an unavoidable attack**
** An unavoidable attack means there's no skill involved. An unavoidable attack should only be used as a Punishment/Game Over for failing an obvious task or being completely unprepared.
