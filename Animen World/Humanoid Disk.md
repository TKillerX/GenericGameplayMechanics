Humanoid are the most abundant on this disk which is why it is named the humanoid disk. They are capable of taking any magic into their body and using it temporarily. Their bodies destroys magic that's ingested, so it is unknown how they are capable of magnifying it. Any magic taken is lot or destroyed and presumably sent to the core. There are some theories that this magic is what fuels Humankins. When the Humanoids destroy enough magic, monsters appear to replenish it. They are not hostile but they do often get in the way.

Despite having to avoid monsters often, the humanoids progressed remarkably quickly to the point where they were the most abundance species on the disc. Due to the abundance of monsters, humanoids had the ability to copy them to assert dominance on the rest of the species. For safety, other species decided to move to other areas of the disc to avoid humanoids.
