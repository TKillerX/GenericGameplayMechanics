Anti-Magic Guild
Head : Platikin
A guild more suitable to the name Magic Reduction Guild, their goal is to spread the message to use less magic from day to day life. The reason is obvious, the waves only get worse because of the magic being produced to fight them and prepare for them. This guild prioritizes physical might.

Anti-Human Guild
Head : Avarioid
A branch of the Anti-Magic Guild that became more extreme. Their goal is to capture or kill humans for starting the waves to begin with. Many have pointed out that this is impossible, but they attempt anyway. This guild will not accept anyone who are allies with humans.

Blacksmith Guild
Head : Sheildoid
A guild that specializes in preparing for the waves. They intend to fight the waves for as long as possible and improve their equipment as the waves improve. They accept anyone strong enough to lift a weapon.

Religious Guild
Head : Humanoid
A guild with unorthodox approach to the waves. They intend to gather enough power to stop waves once and for all. To do so, they will elect one person a god and allow them to deal with the magic fluctuations. They get stronger as more people join and they accept anyone who believes.
