![[Animen Species#^Platikin]]

Creation: Platikin are a species who became a jack of all trades and a master of none. Their very odd bodies mirror this to allow them to shapeshift. They evolved to be more malleable and versatile.

Description: A species whose only defining trait is their beak. They have the ability to shapeshift any other part of their body as long as they maintain the same total weight. Their memories and energy is stored in their beak which is why they cannot change it.

Lifestyle: Eccentric and Erratic. Each platikin's goal is to find what it and only it can do. They advanced through communication with each other to build upon the progress others have made in finding themselves. They live nomadic since they rarely need tools or shelter when they can transform into whatever they need. When a Platikin city is established, it is because they no longer wanted to move.

Inventions: Platikin invented the internet and other forms of long distance communication. They also invented prototypes for easy long distance transportation, but the method of use were unique to each Platikin. Only later did another species make more general models.
