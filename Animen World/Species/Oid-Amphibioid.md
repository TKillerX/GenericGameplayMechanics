![[Animen Species#^Amphiboid]]

Creation: Amphibioids are the creation of the Leviathan. To fight against others, they have the ability to breath air and walk on land in addition to their ability to breath and swim quickly underwater. They were made to be strategists, capable of bringing advantage outside of their home territory.

Description: A bipedal serpent with the ability to manipulate water at will. Their powers are not as destructive as their counterparts, so they use their knowledge to gain the upper hand. They have the finest control over their element of other races.

Lifestyle: Knowledge is everything. The distribution of knowledge is the most important thing for Amphibioids. They are very dispersed around the disc, even on land. The closer Amphibioids are together, the less unique information they can gather. They create networks to allow information to travel quickly. Their capital is underwater and has libraries of all important information gathered.

Inventions: Sonar and eventually radio was invented by Amphiboids. By transferring waves through water and air they were capable of sending information very quickly. While originally large structures were required to transmit and receive, they are only necessary as a signal booster to smaller devices.
