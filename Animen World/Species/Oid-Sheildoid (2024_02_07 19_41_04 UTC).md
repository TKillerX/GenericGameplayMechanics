![[Animen Species#^Sheildoid]]

Creation: Shieldoids are the creation of the Shield Beast. To fight against others, they have a tough exterior to block damage and strong physical powers to cause a lot. They were made to be fighting machines capable of taking lots of damage and dealing lots of damage.

Description: A bipedal tortoise with the ability to manipulate earth at will. Their powers are the weakest but they only use it to supplement their raw strength. They bodies were made for physical force and the ability to summon more defenses is an added bonus.

Sheildoids shells are not attached to their body but instead a weight for training and defense. The weight of the shell is an unspoken competition between the entire race.

Lifestyle: Competition. Each Sheildoid wants to be the very best. They are constantly competing and improving themselves to become better. Sheildoids often live together since they drive each other to be better. The ones that leave and enter other cities typically tries to compete with others while having the obvious upper hand. 

Inventions: Weaponry. The other races can easily rely on their own magical strength but Sheildoids cannot. While magic can be improved endlessly, physical training tend to have diminishing returns. To keep up with accelerated magic use, weapons and armament were created. The capital of the Sheildoids boast the largest armory.
