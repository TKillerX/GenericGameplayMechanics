![[Animen Species#^Humanoid]]

Creation : It is unknown whether the Humankin or the Humanoid appeared first. They both appeared after the other races started to take hold. The Humankin's appearance of a biped with very few other distinguishing features gives rise to the theory that they are the simplified or base version of the other races. The fact that they have the ability of producing raw magic gives evidence for such. They were not created in the image of a god that roamed the lands before, all have been accounted for. The Humankin god appeared after.

Description : A featherless biped capable of producing its own raw magic. Their appearance is about average all around with much less variations than other races. They can be found living in any city. Although it is likely to find the Humankin in a city to be greatest population, by law their majority cannot exceed 50%.

Lifestyle : Humankins like hoarding and having stuff. Huamnkins love creating stuff out of magic and marking their land. They live in excess and are never satisfied.
