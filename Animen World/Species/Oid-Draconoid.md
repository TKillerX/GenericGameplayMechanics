Creation: Draconoids are the creation of the Dragon. To fight against others, they have the ability to breath fire. They are the jack of all trades with the ability to swim, walk, and fly. Due to their versatility, they expend lots of energy and must recover often.

Description: A bipedal lizard demon with the ability to breath and manipulate fire. Their manipulation tends to be smaller scale than Sheildoids on average, they have high raw magical power. They are capable of short yet effective bursts of combat that can easily push back against a wave if executed correctly.

Lifestyle: Hoard and Sleep. Draconoids have the need to hoard, items or energy. Their hoard is their source of power and sleeping lets them tap into it. Draconoids tend to live alone and in small numbers. They are the least populated race on the disc. When they do live together, they prefer comfy fireproof places.

Inventions: Draconoids tend not to invent much since they do not have the energy for such sustained effort. Their most notable inventions are fireproof clothing, bedding, and other quality of life additions to sleep.
