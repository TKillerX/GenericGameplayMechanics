![[Animen Species#^Humankin]]

Creation : It is unknown whether the Humanoid or the Humankin appeared first. They both appeared after the other races started to take hold. The humanoid's appearance of a biped with very few other distinguishing features gives rise to the theory that they are the simplified or base version of the other species. The fact that they have the ability of mimicking other powers without having a way to produce their own gives evidence for such. They didn't evolve, but appeared.

Description : A featherless biped capable of eating anything, especially magical energy and harnessing it itself. Their hunger is never ending with only an infinite magic source capable of keeping the hunger down. Their appearance is about average all around with much less variations than other species. They can be found living in any city. Although it is likely to find the Humankin in a city to be greatest population, their majority rarely exceeds 50%.

Lifestyle : Humankin enjoys causing destruction with their power. They target whatever has the most energy, the most value. They live spread out and fight for resources often at the expense of the other species.
