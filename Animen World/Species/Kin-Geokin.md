![[Animen Species#^Geokin]]

Creation: Geokin are pieces of earth that gained sentience. Their durable exterior and efficient use of energy allows them to live long. They have not evolved much, there was no need to.

Description: A living stone with the ability to naturally generate energy and control its output. They used to not use this ability often, but ever since the humans appeared, there became more and more need for active Geokin to protect their people. Although they do not produce energy as fast as other races, they have a higher storage capacity at the cost of relying solely on that storage to function.

Lifestyle: Efficiency is key. The Geokin are not able to produce their own energy like other more living species. Therefore, they must be very efficient in what they do have. They are patient, they live until they break, so they do not worry about time. Geokin villages are slow, quiet, and devoid of anything interesting.

Inventions: Geokin have invented the wishing orb. While they collect energy, they store excess it in an orb within their body. This process takes thousands of years. Although other species have evolved while Geokin stayed dormant, it is said to still be impossible to take a wishing orb from a Geokin by force.
