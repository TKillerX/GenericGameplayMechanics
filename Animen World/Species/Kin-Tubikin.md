![[Animen Species#^Tubikin]]

Creation: Tubikin are snakes who honed their mind and body for dexterity. Their strengthened mental power and dexterity allow them to manipulate objects without touching it. They evolved to be bigger to keep up with the increasing size of other races and a larger head for better reasoning.

Description: A tube and a head with the ability to move objects with nothing but their mind. They manipulate an object through a single point they can control freely with limitations in size, weight, and distance. They act as invisible hands for the Tubikin with the amount being proportional to their magical strength.

Lifestyle: Pranks. The Tubikin love to play tricks on anyone they can find. The goal is always to play a trick nobody has seen before which introduced this species to engineering. They build elaborate and unpredictable mechanisms in hopes of inventing something new. This tends to lead to inventions with a side effect of being very useful.

Invention: While creating mainly toys and games, the Tubikin are credited for inventing the microwave and teleporter.
