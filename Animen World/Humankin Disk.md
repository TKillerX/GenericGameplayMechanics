Humankins are the most abundant on this disk which is why it is named the humankin disk. They are capable of producing their own unique magic but find it very difficult to harness the magic in the environment. The ability to produce their own magic is very helpful, but it comes at a cost. Their constant production increase the concentration of energy enough to summon monsters. These monsters attempt to balance the difference by any means possible.

Despite having to fight monsters every step of the way, humankins progressed remarkably quickly to the point where they were the most abundance species on the disc. They were capable of fighting back monsters with the magic that called them in the first place. Eventually they were able to create weaponry and technology that made using magic more efficient. While allied with the natural strength of the disk's inhabitants, they were able to push the waves further and further away until it became a yearly cycle.

Waves: Fight for a Year, Rest for a Year

Humankin Ability: Have a substance Q which produces unique magic.
