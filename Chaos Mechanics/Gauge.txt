Gauge
Gauge is a bar to determine the difficulty of a task. The percentage the main value is from the total dictates the scale of any effect that may cause. 


Gauge: Determination
Determination increases stats as health decreases. It starts at 100% and increases inversely as health decreases. This increased percentage gets multiplied into every stat to improve them.


Gauge: Gathering

Gauge: Crafting
Crafting increases the quality of the item being crafted. It starts at 0% and increases as the item is sucessfully being produced. The percentage of sucess multiplies the quality at the end.
