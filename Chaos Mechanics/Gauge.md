Gauge
Gauge is a bar to determine the difficulty of a task. The percentage the main value is from the total dictates the scale of any effect that may cause. 

Time Limit : 10 Turns
Available Resources (X)
Resource Difficulty (B)
Guage Maximum	  (10 * X)
Guage Decrease	  (B - Skill Check)
Resulting Gain	  [X * Gauge% * Passive]

If Gauge% is 100%, gain 50% Bonus.

Gauge: Determination
Determination increases stats as health decreases. It starts at 100% and increases inversely as health decreases. This increased percentage gets multiplied into every stat to improve them.


Gauge: Gathering
Gathering increases loot that appears. It starts at 0% and as the resources are sucessfully gathered. The percentage of resources sucessfully gathered dictates the reward at the end.


Gauge: Crafting
Crafting increases the quality of the item being crafted. It starts at 0% and increases as the item is sucessfully being produced. The percentage of sucess multiplies the quality at the end.


Gauge: Passive XP
Passives have the ability to level up and this gauge dictates how likely it would be. It starts at 0% and increases based on the amount of work put into it. The percentage at the end dictates the odds of a Passive Level Up.
Every 5% Health/Determination or 1 Hour of time is 1 Turn.
Resource Difficulty :New Passive Level * 50
Gauge Maximum	  :New Passive Level * 1000
