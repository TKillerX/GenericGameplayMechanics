### #Magic Rules
The Fundamental Rules of Magic
-   Equivalent Exchange
-   Magic cannot be created or destroyed.
-   Without a catalyst, a mage trying to Kill/KO a human will also Kill/KO the mage.
-   To relieve negative energy, an equal amount of positive energy is needed.
-   Magic is Transferred by Touch
-   Magic is transferred through magic.
-   Magic is transferred through physical contact.
-   Magic moves at the speed of sound.
-   Because catalyst failure is not entirely magic, it occurs faster than sound.
-   Y does not have to follow these rules. -
