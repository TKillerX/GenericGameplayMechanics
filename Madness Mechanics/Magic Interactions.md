### Magic Types
##### #Wind/Entropy - Spring
“Wind magic. Its main interaction is pushing away from the user. Wind magic is very hard to see and very hard to fire in a single direction. A common catalyst is a spring that slowly decompresses. The cataclysmic failure for a spring is a crushing weight downward.”

Interaction with Earth/Contain: Wind Pushes to Earth, Earth Pulls From Wind

##### #Earth/Contain - Ball
“Earth magic. Its main interaction is pulling toward the user. Earth magic is defensive by nature. It is capable of redirection and absorbing impact, but it does not have many ways to push something away. A common catalyst is an airtight container. The cataclysmic failure for the container is a pressure blast.”

Interaction with Fire/Release: Earth lets out fire, Fire brings in Earth
##### #Fire/Release - Iron

“Fire magic. Its main interaction is heat and force. Fire magic applies extra force in any direction, but it requires an initial push. A common catalyst is a metal, preferably heavy. The cataclysmic failure for the metal is a force that compresses everything around into a ball.” 

Interaction with Ice/Order: Fire grows Ice, Ice shrinks Fire.

##### #Ice/Order - Coal

“Ice magic. Its main interaction is cold and, well, anti-force. Ice can freeze objects so that they are no longer affected by any force such as gravity. A common catalyst is coal. The cataclysmic failure is a fiery explosion.” 

Interaction with Wind/Entropy: Ice gives Wind force, Wind takes Ice force.

##### #Elemental Magic - Water
“Elemental magic. This form is not recommended, though it is possible. Elemental mages are capable of stalling a cataclysmic failure almost indefinitely, however their output is far less of the output of a dedicated mage. For an elemental mage to be on par with a dedicated mage, they require a complete catalyst of every element. This is illegal because of how much damage can be caused by someone holding multiple catalysts. To match the skill of a dedicated mage, the elemental mage must have about the same mastery with every element separately.”
