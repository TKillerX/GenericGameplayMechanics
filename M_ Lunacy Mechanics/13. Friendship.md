Friends are companions to help in combat. They level up after completing quests for them. They are not another body to use in combat, but they aid in other ways. Friend skills take an action and use your stats whenever applicable. Friend passives apply to the whole party whenever applicable. You can only have 4 'equipped' friends at a time as a party. There are some exceptions to these rules.
