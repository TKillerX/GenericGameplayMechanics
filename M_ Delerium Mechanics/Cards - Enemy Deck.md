Enemy has Health and can take damage at any time.

How to Use:
While an enemy event is in play, the enemy deck becomes the event deck. Remove all cards greater than the enemy tier from the deck and shuffle. 


At the end of every combo, flip the top card of the enemy deck face up. That is the event. This card cannot be recycled. Enemy events ends when the deck is no longer able to flip more cards or the enemy health reaches zero.
