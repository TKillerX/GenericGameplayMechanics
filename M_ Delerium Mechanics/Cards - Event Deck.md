How to Use
When making an event check, select the card that matches the difficulty of the check. Additionally, select the card that is one higher and one lower in difficulty. If there is none higher or lower, skip it. Then, the event initiator will select one of those cards at random.

How to Use, Roguelike
Shuffle All Events together, then flip the top event card to the top of the stack. That will be the event. Skip players with no cards in hand. Once a stack is done, play the next event to the top of that stack.

Pass an event by discarding a card on top of the event
- Enemy events cannot be passed

Initiate an event by playing a card

- The event card that is initiated cannot be recycled

Fail an event by not reaching the threshold

An event is cleared once the score threshold is reached. A card must be played to get event rewards. Decks are shuffled at the end of the event.
