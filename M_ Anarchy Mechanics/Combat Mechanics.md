#### Summoning
Use a skill that creates an ally. This ally has a basic AI.

Summons cannot act the turn they are summoned. Being summoned takes both of their actions.

#### Blocking
Take aggro from an attack. 
Subtract appropriate DEF/MDF twice instead of once.
Deal Damage equal to PHY or MAG once per hit taken.

#### Multi
Cast a skill multiple times by paying its cost once. Extra multi against a defeated target is wasted.

#### Range
Cast a skill once per target in range. Damage is dealt accordingly. X values are determined as if only 1 was attacked. Attacker can choose which will count.
