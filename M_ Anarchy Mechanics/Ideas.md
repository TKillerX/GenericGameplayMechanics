Gives every move a multi-hit

Every 5 speed is 1 more action, multiplying multihits aswell
Speed multihits do not change target

this would require an increase to health
VIT x LVL for Enemies
VIT x 10 for players

To balance this system, defense will counter speed builds
A single block decreases every multihit's damage and does a reflect effect for each hit
