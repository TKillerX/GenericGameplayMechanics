## 1. Role
#### Stall (Tank) (A) - Resists Interactions
*~"You can't win if I don't lose"*

The goal of the tank is to keep the team alive long enough for the team to win. It also wants to waste enemy resources. An indestructible brick is not a tank since it doesn't draw attention to get rid of it. A tank must have enough interaction to make it a threat to leave alone, but it does not have to be the main win condition.

#### Accelerate (Support) (B - Improves Interactions
*~"I take away your stats, for good"*

The goal of a supporter is to speed up allies or slow down enemies. 

Stall Effects
- Skip Turn
- Reduce Damage
- Increase Defense

Win Effects
- Double Turn
- Increase Damage
- Reduce Defense

Some status effects cause damage. If it just deals damage and nothing else, that falls under the Win category.

#### Win (DPS) (C) - Interacts
*~"The best defense is overwhelming offense."*

The goal of the DPS is to win. It does this typically by putting enemy hp bars to zero. DPS stands for Damage Per Second which a greater DPS means you kill things faster. A few games have instant win effects, in which those effects can also be considered DPS. I'll consider it DPS. A DPS is not required, but is efficient.

## 2. Speed
#### Fast (X) - Constant Strength, Diminishing Returns
*~"You are already dead"*
- Good Early, Worse Later

Fast classes tend to stay the same during the course of the combat or of the game. If the combat isn't finished early, these classes will run out of resources. Good for a blitzing strategy that doesn't require set-up bit is not good for anything other than that. 

Examples
- Static Damage Summons
- High Mana Cost Mages
- Start Combat Effects

#### Normal (Y) - Linear, Baseline
*~"Nice and Reliable"*
- Decent Early, Decent Late

The baseline of the game. Good enough to compete and disrupt fast classes, not fast enough to disrupt setup. These classes rely more on versatility more than brute force. 

Examples
- AoE Attackers
- Hybrid Melee and Ranged
#### Slow (Z) - Exponential, Late Game
*~"Just stall for five more turns"*
- Bad Early, Good Late

These classes are really good with a lot of investment. The difficulty in this class is not whether they'll let you win, but whether the investment is worth it. Once invested it is very hard to take down, so it is almost a ticking clock.

Examples
- Charged Attacks
- Ultimate Moves

## 3. Type
#### Random (I)
Win using probability. Risk versus reward.

A good class is consistent, so this class type is already at a disadvantage. What'll make this class stand out is the strength of the effects. These big effects make the class a lot more fun than a predictable game of solitaire. Maybe give these class types a fail-safe though, a one time use consistency button.

- (A) Dodge Chance
		On Average, Dodge Chance is equal to damage reduction. Dodge chance is better against instant kills but worse against consistent high damage.
- (B) Multi hit Chance
		On Average, A effect or range multiplier. The value of this is the potential range.
- (C) Crit Chance
		On Average, A damage multiplier. The value is that this is another multiplier on top of any other easier to obtain multipliers. The downside is the randomness.

#### Constant (J)
Win knowing exactly what you are doing.

A good class is consistent, but consistency is boring sometimes. When you are losing, you're losing and when you are winning, you're winning. Classes of this type are easy but tend to get overwhelmed if they can't win fast enough.

- (A) Static Defense
		A number that flatly decreases damage or effects. Very good at low and comparable damages. Bad against high damages.
- (B) Static Range
		A specific range for an attack. Not targets, range. Has some unpredictability in the way opponents may stand, but overall it does not change much of the consistency. 
- (C) Static Damage
		A set number for damage. Can have interesting interactions with buffs since it typically does not scale with a stat. Can be greater than pre-buff damage but worse than post-buff damage which makes it good for fast classes.
#### Stacking (K)
Win eventually with time on your side

A good class is consistent, but this class's consistency comes with time. Generally better for slower classes, but this does allow faster classes a chance to catch up a little. Classes of this type get really good if they can manage to survive.
- (A) Regen Effects
		End of turn effects such as healing. Similar to static defense, however regenerate happens after the damage. In terms of high damage attacks, static is better. For lower damage attacks, regen takes it.
- (B) Stacking Effects
		Effects that start small but eventually become really big. Depending how easy it is to get rid of, these effects could be easy or hard to stack.
- (C) Over Time Effects
		Let time do the work. Damage Over Time allows set-up to happen while also dealing damage. The costs is that these effects are typically weaker.


Note: Games that make bosses immune/highly resistant to status eliminates supporter roles.
- Counter Point: Support is not normally necessary. Supporters on the players side makes the game easier while supporters on the enemy side makes the game harder. A properly balanced game does not need support.
	- Counter Counter Point: Having bosses immune to status while inflicting their own strictly decelerates and why would you want that? Especially for important statuses such as silence.
