Gauge
A gauge is a measurement of a resource. They go up and down depending on actions taken. Gauges tend to be used at any time to apply a variety of effects.

## Stat Gauges
### Decreasing Gauge
**Health Points**: When this gauge goes to zero that entity is out of combat. All damage not blocked decreases this gauge.
Equal to Constitution x 10

**Mana Points**: This Gauge is a potential resource for using skills. It can also be spent to **block magical** attacks.
Equal to Wisdom x 5

**Stamina Points**: this Gauge is a potential resource for using skills. It can also be spent to **block physical** attacks.
Equal to Agility x 5

### Increasing Gauge
These gauges increases when using their corresponding stat by that stat. Each Gauge is equal to the stat x 5.

**Strength Gauge**: Every 10 temporarily increases Str stat by 1. 
**Intelligence Gauge**: Every 10 temporarily increases Int stat by 1.
**Perception Gauge**: Every 10 temporarily increases Per stat by 1.

The **maximum gauge** is 10x the base stat.

### Determination Gauge
This gauge increases when using any stat or taking damage. They are spent to directly increase damage.

Every 100 increases stats by 10.
When Spent, Every 100 increases damage by 20.

## Skill Gauges
### Attack Gauges
These gauges are used to activate skills.

**Time Gauge**: Increases by 1 for every turn saved to a cap of 3. The cap can be increased. The **time gauge resets** after taking a hostile action or ending combat.

**Regenerating Gauge**: Increases by 1 every turn to a cap of 5. The cap and regen rate can be increased.
Regenerating to Resource Gathering Ratio = 1 : 50

**Resource Gauge**: Does not increase during combat, must be gathered outside of combat.

**Energy Gauge**: The energy required to use an attack. This is always equal to mana or stamina depending on the skill, or health if the corresponding gauge is 0.

### Resource Gauges
Resource gauges are created and used to satisfy conditions. Resources are universal.

#### Gathering Resource
In between combat there is an opportunity to gather resources. All gauges are saved and Health/ Mana/ And Stamina is filled at the start. Any gauge can be used to gather resources with a conversion rate **except time** since it resets to 0.

All gauges are 1 : 1 to resource unless otherwise stated.
Gathering jobs increase the resources earned per gauge spent.

### Gauge: Passive EXP
While using a passive, track all -spent- gauge on it. They can level up.

EXP Needed
Lvl 1 - 100
Lvl 2 - 400
Lvl 3 - 900
Lvl 4 - 1600
LVl 5 - 2500

Or use this formula: 
EXP Needed = LVL * LVL * 100
